        Indian Premier League teams can retain up to 4 players in the lead up to the mega auction for IPL 2022, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has conveyed in a letter to the franchises. The two new teams who will be part of the
        next season will be allowed to pick 3 players before the auction.
        A source close to the board confirmed the developments to India Today on Saturday. The existing 8 franchises will be allowed to retain their players between November 1 and 30 while the two new teams can pick 3 players from the released list
        of players or elsewhere from December 1. The deadline for picking the set of 3 players for the new teams is December 25.
